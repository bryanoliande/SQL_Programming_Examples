Note: This is all the work I submitted for CS122A (Introduction To Databases), a class I took at UCI during the Winter quarter of 2016. The instructions for the assignments were stored on a private website:
 https://sites.google.com/site/cs122awinter2016/

that can no longer be accessed. This folder is just the answers to the assignments, not their descriptions. It is just proof that I have worked with SQL before, I cannot recall the questions.
